const airpods = `Zach wants the Airpods Pros 2 because one of his airpods fell out of his ear while biking and got ran over by a car. According to
 Reddit, these are the best in-ear, wireless audio experience for Apple devices. I'd be fine with something else, but these are pretty neat.`

const matfer = `Zach wants a carbon steel pan because non-stick is a little too fussy when it comes to cleaning, stainless steel isn't non-stick and 
can be a pain to clean at times, and cast iron is too heavy to saute. Carbon steel seems to be the happy medium between them all. Any carbon steel
pan is good, but America's Test Kitchen said this one was their favorite and, since I know nothing about carbon steel pan quality, I am 
tempted to just trust them. Plus this is on the cheaper end for carbon steel pans. These come in various sizes.`

const razor = `Zach has a shavette which is like a straight razor, but it has a little insert that you put a disposable razor blade into. Zach is annoyed
by the fact that he has to keep buying the inserts when a straight razor would basically be a permanent version of that. He tried a safety razor, but it
was bad at cutting the hair on his neck, which caused irritation. Therefore, this is the ideal shaving item for him.`

const strop = `Zach would only need this if you got the Dovo Special Straight Razor or some other straight razor, as its purpose is to hone the razor of a 
straight razor.`

const pillow = `Zach has two silk pillow cases, but learned that satin pillow cases are not only cheaper, but just as affective at benefitting those with acne
as well as those with curly hair, two things Zach has. This is a nice cheap option if you're looking to get him something but don't want to break the bank.`

const nasacort = `Nasacort is prohibatively expensive for some reason. It marginally helps Zach sleep at night, so buying me a 4 pack would be a great way to ensure he
gets a good night of sleep for a long period of time.`

const furbo = `Zach has a lot of anxiety and one of the ways it expresses itself is through worrying about the well-being of his cats while he is away. Getting Zach a Furbo
would ensure he could check in on his cats whenever he needs to see if they're doing well. Plus it has a treat launcher so Calvin will be happy.`

const air_purifier = `Zach's apartment, much like many apartments in NYC, is dusty as all Hell. According to the internet, air purifiers are a great way to limit the amount
of dust. On top of that, cats spread their hormones by rubbing their faces on things. In a smaller space, that smell becomes noticeable. The air purifier could help combat that scent.
The Coway Airmega 200m was something I read was good in a bunch of different articles/reddit comments so it's what I listed, but any air purifier would be good.`

const shoes = `Zach has had the same pair of sneakers for over 4 years, to the point where he doesn't even remember when he got them. He has only purchased one pair of shoes within the last 3 years,
the ones his parents bought for him in Italy, but they're too small and they give him blisters, so they're only something he wears in certain fancy occasions. A pair of New Balance sneaks would 
be a great gift to ensure he has comfy footwear options in the lower range of shoes price-wise.`

const masa = `Zach used to make tacos every night for a good 3 months. Even though it's no longer a daily ritual for him, he still makes them regularly. Zach wants to branch out past the same masa he
has been using for the past year, Maseca, in both color (this set has 4 different types of corn) and company. This heirloom masa harina set would be a fun addition to his cooking escapades.`

const schoolOfRock = `Zach stopped playing the bass for some time due to his tendonitis. He also has a lot of anxiety about putting himself out there. Zach wants to get back into playing the bass and wants to 
play in a band, both of which are options through the School of Rock Adult Program. Here, he can take part in a band of fellow adults looking to play music on top of getting lessons. You could also opt to just get 
Zach the lessons.`

const plants = `Zach feels like his apartment is very bare, which doesn't exactly bother him, but makes him worry that visitors would think of him as being a murderer or too sterotypically masculine. Plants would be a 
good way of helping him get over that concern. The Luscious Trinity is a luxurious option of getting Zach three separate plants that are all pet friendly, something that is integral when living with cats like Zach does.
Other plant options are also acceptable, this was just one that stood out.`

const elkay = `One of the most important parts of staying healthy is by hydrating, and the best way to hydrate is by drinking water. By purchasing Zach an ElkaY LZS8WSLK EZH2O Drinking Fountain Station, you can ensure he'll always have easy access to 
water and in such a good looking fashion. It's definitely a little pricey, but I'd say it's worth it if you love him, which you most definitely do I assume...`
